# BookSearch

## Description:

This project originally began as a fully functioning Google Books API search engine, which was developed using a RESTful API architecture. The application allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and view detailed results. In the refactored version, the project was transformed into a more modern and efficient system by replacing the RESTful API with a GraphQL API, utilizing Apollo Server.
